# Manual setup steps for prd_agent_rag

The generator created the code. These are the **one-time external setup steps**
that can't be automated — accounts to create, keys to copy, services to provision.

> Skip ahead to "After every deploy" at the bottom for things you'll re-do
> regularly. Items above are one-time per environment.

## Secrets

```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
```

Then in `backend/.env`:

- [ ] **`SECRET_KEY`** — replace with a fresh value: `openssl rand -hex 32`
- [ ] **`API_KEY`** — replace with a fresh value: `openssl rand -hex 32`

These are used to sign JWTs and authenticate service-to-service calls. Rotate at every environment promotion (dev → staging → prod each get their own).


## SQLite

- [ ] Nothing to provision — file `prd_agent_rag.db` will be created on first run.
- [ ] Run migrations: `cd backend && uv run alembic upgrade head`.

## OpenAI

- [ ] Create API key at https://platform.openai.com/api-keys.
- [ ] Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env`.
- [ ] (Optional) Set spending limit on OpenAI dashboard to avoid surprise bills.

## RAG (chromadb)

- [ ] Local: `docker compose up -d chroma` (or run embedded mode — set `CHROMA_HOST=localhost`).
- [ ] No managed cloud service for Chroma; use Milvus or Qdrant in production.

- [ ] (Optional) Ingest seed documents: `uv run prd_agent_rag rag-ingest /path/to/file.pdf --collection docs`.

---

## After every deploy

- [ ] Run database migrations: `alembic upgrade head` (CI step or post-deploy job).
- [ ] Smoke test `/api/v1/health` returns `{"status": "ok"}`.
- [ ] Frontend loads, login → dashboard flow works.
- [ ] Logs flowing to your aggregator.
